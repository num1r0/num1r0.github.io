Let's solve some crackme challenges for Android. This post is going to be updated once new crackmes are out. All files have been tested both, in emulator and on physical device, so running them shouldn't be a problem.

## Description.

This is the page where I’m going to post all my crackme challenges for Android. There are 3 difficulties: `EASY`, `MEDIUM`, `HARD`, let’s keep it simple =)) All samples are intended to run smoothly on Android Emulator, so no hardware devices are necessary (however, you can use one if you want to).

If you have any questions or just want to say “hi”, feel free to ping me (contacts at the bottom of the page).

## Tools.

There are several Android tools you will probably need. It’s not a definitive list, so feel free to use anything else:

- [APKTool](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/ "APKTool repository") - A tool for reverse engineering Android apk files;
- [dex2jar](https://github.com/pxb1988/dex2jar "dex2jar repository") - Tools to work with android .dex and java .class files;
- [fakedns](https://github.com/Crypt0s/FakeDns "fakedns repository") - A regular-expression based python MITM DNS server with support for DNS Rebinding attacks;
- [jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx "jadx repository") - Dex to Java decompiler;
- [JD-Gui](http://jd.benow.ca/ "JD-Gui website") - Yet another fast Java decompiler;

## Crackme apps.
